I recently used Franck for a project at my home, and I am proud to say that it was a fantastic choice. <span class='smart-mark'>He is an excellent, HIGHLY CREATIVE and technically sound architect</span> and, no less important, a people person through and through. He was able to take a modest space with seemingly limited options and <span class='smart-mark'>transform it into a bright, airy office that far exceeded my expectations.</span> I highly recommend him and in fact will use no one else in the future."},{"Photo":null,"Header":null,"Content":"<span class='smart-mark'>Best architect that i know</span> i really advise to take him.
